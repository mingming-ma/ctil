There once was a man from Peru;who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.

There was a young lady from Leeds
Who swallowed a package of seeds.
Now this sorry young lass
Is quite covered in grass,
But has all the tomatoes she needs.

There once was a baby named Lou
And he grew and he grew and he grew
And he grew and he grew
And he grew and he grew, But he stopped when he reached six foot two.
